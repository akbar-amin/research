## Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)
The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, the goal was to use the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) to solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) as accurately as possible. 

Implementations of DGM are done in PyTorch and Tensorflow, although only the PyTorch version is used for training and experiments. Only the loss function differs between the two.
